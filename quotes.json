You can see the reblog in front of you, and you can find the original post - by itself, completely devoid of context - but you can't click thru to the previous reblog. This is apparently intentional, since I literally emailed support about it - being able to click back thru the reblog chain and being able to see the source post in context on op's blog are fundamental parts of the user experience imo and I am pissed - and their response was basically like yeah we meant to do that but if you want to talk about it you can go to our WIP blog, where the ask is literally only open one day a week and we will completely ignore you.
